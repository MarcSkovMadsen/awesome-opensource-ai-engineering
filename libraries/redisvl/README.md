[![The AI Engineer presents RedisVL](redisvl_1920x192.png)]
## Overview
RedisVL provides a Python client library to leverage Redis as a vector database. Features semantic search, robust indexing, vector creation via OpenAI/HF/GCP, filtering, JSON storage, CLI & more. Simple yet powerful.

## Description
RedisVL is an open-source Python client library that enables using Redis as a full-fledged vector database for building semantic search applications. It simplifies and accelerates working with vectors at scale by harnessing Redis' speed and reliability.

### Key Highlights

⚡️ Blazing fast queries powered by Redis' performance

🧭 Intuitive search interface with filtering, geospatial, numeric ops

📑 Schema-based index management for vectors

🎨 Vector creation utilities integrating OpenAI, HuggingFace etc

📦 JSON storage and retrieval

🛠️ CLI and management commands

Whether you want to build a conversational engine, recommendations system, or any other vector similarity-based application, RedisVL equipped with Redis' maturity makes it smooth.

It delivers production-grade tooling like index manipulation, robust querying constructs and caching right out of the box. The simple yet full-featured capabilities help minimize effort and cost.

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about RedisVL?
1. 👩‍💻 It provides an easy-to-use Python client library to build vector similarity search applications quickly. Less time fussing with infrastructure means faster development. 🚀
2. ⚡️ It leverages the speed and reliability of Redis to deliver high-performance vector search to power real-time recommendations and matching. Sub-millisecond response times keep users engaged.
3. 🌈 It simplifies working with embeddings by integrating directly with top vectorization services like OpenAI, HuggingFace, and VertexAI. Create vectors without needing to run complex ML training jobs.
4. 🧩 It enables hybrid search combining vectors, filters, and full-text search. More flexibility to tailor the search experience to your needs.
5. 🔒 It ensures high availability and data persistence through Redis. Applications remain operational 24/7 thanks to Redis' built-in replication and persistence.
