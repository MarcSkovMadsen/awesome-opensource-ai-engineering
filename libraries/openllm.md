# OpenLLM

## Overview
OpenLLM - AI library of the day: OpenLLM by BentoML is an open platform for operating any LLM in production. Fine-tune, serve, deploy & monitor LLMs like GPT-3 with ease. Supports streaming, adapters, and multi-GPUs & integrates with BentoML, LlamaIndex, LangChain & more.

OpenLLM by BentoML is an open-source platform designed to facilitate the deployment and operation of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in real-world applications. It delivers a comprehensive suite of tools and features for fine-tuning, serving, deploying, and monitoring LLMs, simplifying the end-to-end deployment workflow.

## Key Highlights

🚀 Deploy any open-source LLM with a single command. Spin up servers for models like OPT, Flan-T5, Llama, Stable Diffusion, and more in seconds.

⚡ Stream responses directly from LLMs with token streaming support. Enable continuous batching for increased throughput.

🛠️ Fine-tune models by serving adapters and low-rank layers. Modify model behavior for your specific use case.

🎚️ Quantize models like GPT-3 for lower latency and cost using techniques like int8, int4, GPTQ, SqueezeLLM, etc.

📈 Monitor model quality via built-in analytics on scores, costs, and latency. Identify bad versions.

🛳️ Easy deployment to cloud platforms like BentoCloud Serverless. Automatically scales perf & cost.

🤝 Integrates with BentoML, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Transformers Agents, and more. Drop in replacement for OpenAI API.

Whether you want to build production-ready apps with LLMs or optimize and monitor existing deployments, OpenLLM provides the missing glue. With its broad model support, streaming capabilities, and DevOps features, you can deploy even the largest LLMs smoothly and productively.
