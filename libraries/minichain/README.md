## Overview
MiniChain is a tiny #Python library for easily chaining prompts with large language models. Annotate functions to call models, visualize chains, and more - all in a few lines of code!

## Description
As large language models (LLMs) advance, developers need better ways to chain prompts together to create sophisticated assistants, search engines, and more. However, many libraries tackling this space have grown extremely complex.

👩‍💻 That's where MiniChain comes in - a tiny, laser-focused Python library for chaining LLM prompts in just a few lines of code! 

### 💡 MiniChain Key Highlights
✅ Annotate functions to call LLMs like GPT-3 or Cohere. Build chains by calling these functions.

📊 Visualize chains in notebooks or apps with integrated Gradio support. See the full graph.

💾 Manage state across calls using simple data structures like queues. There is no need for complex, persistent storage.

📜 Separate prompts from code logic using template files. Keep things clean.

🔀 Support tools that call different backends based on arguments. Flexible orchestration.

🤖 Auto-generate typed prompt headers based on Python dataclass definitions.

You get the core prompt chaining functionality without unnecessary complexity. Whether you want assistants, search engines, QA systems, or more, MiniChain turbocharges development.
