## Overview
RAGs lets you build your own "ChatGPT over data" in 3 steps: describe your task and data, configure parameters like top-k retrieval, then query your data via convo with the auto-generated RAG agent. 

## Description
RAGs is an open source Streamlit application that allows you to create your own Retrieve and Generate (RAG) pipeline to query over your data through natural language conversations.

### 💡 rags Key Highlights
- 1️⃣  Natural language setup: Describe your dataset and desired task in plain English to initialize a RAG system. No coding needed.

- 2️⃣  Customizable architecture: Tailor parameters like top-k retrieval, summarization options, choice of language model, and more through an intuitive UI.

- 3️⃣  Conversational interaction: Once configured, engage in a chatbot-style dialogue where the RAG agent answers your natural language questions by selecting and applying the right tools to your data.

So in just 3 steps, RAGs allows you to go from idea to implementation of a production-grade RAG system fine-tuned to your use case, no coding required. It democratizes access to this advanced NLP technique and makes querying data through conversation available to all.

The goal is to enable "ChatGPT over your data" for everyone. 

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about rags?

1. Rapid prototyping: RAGs allows quick iteration of RAG systems to test ideas and POCs without coding a full pipeline. The easy setup and configuration through natural language simplifies exploration.

2. Customization: AI engineers can really dig into customizing RAG parameters like retrieval, summarization, embedding models, choice of LLMs, etc. This flexibility allows tight control to build the perfect architecture.

3. Scalability: Since RAGs handles the underlying pipeline assembly, engineers can focus higher level problems like scaling, deployment, and integration. Building custom interfaces/frontends is also easier.

4. Education: For AI engineers looking to learn, RAGs exposes all key components of a RAG system through an intuitive UI. Great for hands-on experimentation and tinkering.

5. Community: As an open source project, RAGs offers opportunity to collaborate, contribute ideas/code, and engage with an active community advancing the state of conversational AI.

In summary, RAGs combines simplicity with depth for rapidly constructing tailored RAG systems. Whether prototyping or deploying highly custom solutions, it's a valuable tool for any AI engineer working at the cutting edge of NLP.
