Axflow is a modular TypeScript framework for building robust AI apps. Includes React hooks and utilities for streaming, modules to connect data to LLMs, evaluate outputs, serve models, and more.

## Description
Axflow is an open-source TypeScript framework for building robust natural language AI applications. It provides developers with a modular, code-first approach to seamlessly leverage large language models (LLMs).

## Key Highlights:

- **@axflow/models**🤖 - An SDK with React hooks and utilities to integrate LLMs into apps and enable streaming responses. It makes building AI frontends intuitive.
- **axgen**⚙️ - Connect your data sources and documents to LLMs to generate outputs like summaries, answers, translations, etc.
- **axeval**📈 - Evaluate the quality of LLM outputs using customizable metrics for your use case.
- **extract**📥 - Load, transform, and chunk documents from any source to prepare data for LLMs efficiently.
- **serve**🚀 - Serve any LLM with options like throttling, analytics, and logging.
- **finetune**🔧 - Fine-tune LLMs on your own datasets.

Axflow emphasizes flexibility and control for developers through its modular, code-first approach. It deconstructs complex LLM workflows into intuitive building blocks you can adopt incrementally.

Whether you want to build custom NLP-powered apps 📱 or scale existing ones to the next level, Axflow provides the components to make it happen faster with TypeScript.
