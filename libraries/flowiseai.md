# Flowise AI

## Overview
[FlowiseAI (YC S23)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flowiseai/) is an open-source drag-and-drop tool that allows anyone to build customized large language models (LLM) visual flows and backends for question-answering applications, summarization, and analysis.

With the rapid advancement of models like ChatGPT, LLMs are revolutionizing every industry. But how can less technical people utilize them for their own use cases? Flowise provides a LEGO-like interface to connect components like PDF loaders, OpenAI Embeddings, and vector databases to create customized ChatGPT tailored to your documents and data. You learn as you visually build!

## Key benefits

1️⃣ Open source with an MIT license, so it's free for commercial and personal use

2️⃣ Build backends and flows faster by seeing them execute live as you connect components

3️⃣ Highly extensible to integrate custom components using libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace, etc.

4️⃣ Drag-and-drop chat flows to interact with flows in real time

5️⃣ Expose flows as APIs or embed them into applications

6️⃣ Create tools that automate workflows, like fetching stock prices and adding to Airtable

If you're looking to leverage large language models like ChatGPT for your own use cases, Flowise's visual programming approach makes doing so incredibly intuitive. Get started in minutes by installing with NPM or spinning up a Docker container. Join the open-source community pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs for all!
