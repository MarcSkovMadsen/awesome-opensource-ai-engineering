# LLM-VM
## Overview
LLM-VM lets developers easily build apps powered by LLMs without managing infra. Just provide data/APIs, and it handles prompt engineering, fine-tuning, load balancing between models, and more!

## Description
LLM-VM is an open source platform that dramatically simplifies building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). 🤖

It acts as a virtual machine sitting between your code and LLMs, taking care of the heavy lifting so you can focus on your app's business logic. 

### 💡 LLM-VM Key Highlights

- ✅ Natural Language Compilation - Translates conversational instructions into dynamic LLM prompts and commands. 💬

- ✅ Automatic Fine-Tuning - Iteratively improves data and parameters for your models and use cases. 🧑‍🔧

- ✅ Load Balancing - Splits requests across multiple models and providers. 📊

- ✅ Tool Orchestration - Coordinates data sources, APIs, code hooks and more into LLM workflows. ⚙️

- ✅ Optimization - State-of-the-art optimizations like batching and quantization customized per model. ⚡️

The goal is to make leveraging LLMs reliable and scalable while abstracting away the complexity. This means faster iteration and cheaper, more robust applications!

Whether you're a solo developer or enterprise team, LLM-VM is the fastest way to build the next generation of language-powered products. 🚀


### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about LLM-VM?

1. 🛠 Simplicity - Abstracts away infrastructure so engineers can focus on product logic and capabilities using LLMs versus managing complexity.
2. 📦 Modularity - Swap out models, data sources, and APIs with no code changes. Great for testing ideas.
3. ⚡️ Optimization - State-of-the-art batching, quantization, etc., which would be costly to build custom means better performance.
4. 💪 Reliability - Handles load balancing across models & providers, auto fine-tuning for consistency, and failover for robustness.
5. 🔌 Extensibility - Add agents to connect new data sources and services with just descriptions for easy extensibility.

In summary, LLM-VM handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting so engineers can rapidly build and iterate language-based products. It saves time and cost while providing guardrails and best practices for success with LLMs.
