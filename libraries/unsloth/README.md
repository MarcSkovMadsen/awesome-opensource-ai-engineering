## Overview
Unsloth turbocharges LLM fine-tuning, making it up to 30x faster & using 60% less memory. Supports NVIDIA, Intel, AMD GPUs. Even the free open source version trains 2-5x faster.

## Description
Unsloth is an open source library that supercharges large language model (LLM) fine-tuning for state-of-the-art speed ⚡️ and efficiency. 💡

### 💡 unsloth Key Highlights

- 👨‍🔧 Manual Autograd Engine - Hand derived matrix calculus backpropagation for peak performance.
- ⚙️ Custom Kernels - All core kernels rewritten in performant Triton language.
- 🔋 Quantization - 4 bit and 16 bit support to slash memory usage by 50%.
- 📈 Modular Optimizations - Customized optimization per model architecture for ideal throughput.

This enables benefits like:

- 🚀 Up to 30x faster fine-tuning than baseline HuggingFace.
- 🧑‍💻 60% less GPU memory consumption allowing much larger batch sizes.
- 🎚️ Works out-of-the-box with all NVIDIA and also Intel, Habana, AMD chips.

The free open source version trains 2-5x faster with 50% less memory versus baseline!

So whether you're looking to turbocharge research 🚗 or deploy models faster 🏎️, Unsloth is the ultimate LLM accelerator.

### 🤔 Why should The AI Engineer care about unsloth?

1. ⚡️ Rapid Prototyping - Quickly iterate and test ideas with up to 30x faster fine-tuning turnaround times.
2. 💰 Cost Savings - Train models faster and with less GPU memory for dramatically lower compute costs.
3. 🏭 Productization - Speed up research to production rollout of LLM models and capabilities.
4. 🔧 Customization - Modular design allows tuning optimizations specifically for your model architectures.
5. 🕰️ Future-proofing - Innovations like manual autograd frees you from relying on frameworks' built-in limitations.

In summary, Unsloth gives AI engineers the two most precious resources - time and money. Whether researching cutting edge techniques or deploying LLMs at scale, faster innovation and reduced costs will drive impact.
